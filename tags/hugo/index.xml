Initially, my personal website was a simple online CV, built with plain HTML and Bootstrap, and hosted on AWS S3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After exploring my options, I searched for a static site generator that would allow me to publish blog posts using &lt;em&gt;Markdown&lt;/em&gt;. This approach seemed perfect since I was already familiar with &lt;em&gt;Markdown&lt;/em&gt;. This search led me to &lt;a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. The learning curve with Jekyll was minimal, and setting up the website on GitHub Pages was straightforward. However, I eventually got caught up in other projects and life, and never managed to complete the blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
