Initially, my personal website was a simple online CV, built with plain HTML and Bootstrap, and hosted on AWS S3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After exploring my options, I began searching for a suitable static site generator that would allow me to publish blog posts using markdown. This approach seemed perfect since I was already familiar with markdown. This search led me to &lt;a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jekyll&lt;/a>. The learning curve with Jekyll was minimal, and setting up the website on GitHub Pages was straightforward. However, I eventually got caught up in other projects and life, and never managed to complete the blog.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
